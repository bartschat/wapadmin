Installation of  wap administration is very simple! :)

Just copy the files into a directory which is accessible through 
your webserver. 

Try to get http://your.server/your/dir/index.wml

Now you have to create a database on your mysql server and import the 
file wapadmin.sql into it. This can easily be done with phpmyadmin or 
with the mysql console client: 

  mysql -u wapadmin -p -h localhost wapadmin < ./sql/wapadmin.sql

After doing this you can log on to wapadmin with username and 
password 'admin'. :)
User management will be added soon. 

Last thing to do is to edit config.php to fit to your needs...
